This above link gives a full course on Python. Navin Reddy is the teacher in the video. He simplifies every

It's one of the best websites I keep visiting to learn anything about coding. This website also gives us examples to try 
them all by ourselves. We will not need to install any software to work on examples while studying on this website. 
They have their own compilers. In that way its a very convenient website to learn any programming language.
